# Finding a Safe Area

During the reopening period in the US, we need to be aware of social distancing and avoid cross social contact with our fellow Americans. Since cases are on the rise and reopening in some states have halted recently, we want to know on how to find a perfect place with low amount of people for an event. This website allows us to form an event, keep track of anyone attending, and have a chatbot application to monitor certain places with respective population to avoid overcrowded areas, which increases the risks of COVID-19 spread. Our website and chatbot application has being created with the utilization of canvas, css3, flask, html5, javascript, postgresql, python, and sql. 

This project has being submitted into New Hacks Who This? Hackathon on Devpost during 7/10/2020 through 7\12\2020.
